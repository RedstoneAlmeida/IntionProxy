# IntionProxy
*Rewrite with BungeeCord for Nukkit*

 > **Features**
- There have been some changes, now it is possible to access all players separately per server and it is also not necessary for the player to connect to the lobby first in order to be connected to the proxy
- It is possible to create basic plugins using javascript
- Performance improvements and more packets to grab more data and further improve how servers communicate
- NukkitRunnable or NukkitTask style loop/scheduler systems
- Plugin embedded in same jar file

 > **Improvements**
- I want to improve the plugin system further, adding the plugin possibility in .jar
- Get the full server information with Address so you can use commands like "transfer NICKNAME ServerName" (example: transfer RedstoneAlmeida Skywars-1)
- More commands
- More stable and more simplistic for easy setup

 > **Commands**
- Transfer, be like transfer with bonus. Use: "transfer RedstoneAlmeida ServerName 0.0.0.0 19133"
- Stop, well... stopping proxy.
- List, see all connected servers
- Say, you send message to all servers, Use: "say example message"
- Plugins, see all archives loaded, example: Loaded: test.js, test2.js... 

*Well, welcome to a new connection system for nukkit.*
